# **Glyph — Examples**

This directory contains **end-to-end examples** demonstrating how Glyph is used across the **Golden Stack** and beyond.

Examples are not demos.
They are **reference implementations** that reflect best practices, security constraints, and real integration patterns.

---

## 1. Purpose of Examples

The examples directory exists to:

* Show **how Glyph is embedded**, not just written
* Demonstrate **host–module boundaries**
* Illustrate **capability usage** in practice
* Provide **copy-paste starting points**
* Validate that the ecosystem works end-to-end

Examples must always align with the **spec and runtime behavior**.

## 6. Jaspr Examples (`examples/jaspr/`)

**Focus:** Dart-first web development

Demonstrates:

* Glyph modules running in the browser (WASM)
* Jaspr integration
* Shared logic between Flutter and web
* Deterministic client behavior

Typical use cases:

* Shared UI logic

## 7. Gladiolus Examples (`examples/gladiolus/`)

**Focus:** Game scripting

Demonstrates:

* Gameplay rules in Glyph
* Event-driven logic
* Safe modding patterns
* Deterministic simulation

Typical use cases:

* Game mods
* AI behavior scripting
* Rule engines
* Replay-safe logic

---

## 8. Shared Utilities (`examples/shared/`)

Contains:

* Common Glyph modules
* Test fixtures
* Capability mocks
* Helper scripts

Used across multiple examples.

---

## 9. Quality Bar for Examples

All examples must:

* Declare capabilities explicitly
* Include a README explaining intent
* Run without undocumented setup
* Avoid dev-only shortcuts unless stated
* Match current specs and runtime behavior

Examples are part of the test surface.

---

## 10. Adding New Examples

When adding an example:

1. Choose the closest category
2. Add a README explaining:

   * what it demonstrates
   * which capabilities it needs
   * how to run it
3. Keep scope narrow
4. Update this index if needed
